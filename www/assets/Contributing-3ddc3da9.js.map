Adhering to these principles will help maintain consistency and a cohesive user experience.\\n\\n- Have a look at the [Storybook demos](https://synergy-design-system.github.io/?path=/docs/components-syn-button--docs) to get a better understanding of the design system and its components.\\n\\n- Synergy components are embedded in a monorepo structure with packages (e. g. `components`) managed by `pnpm` (instead of `npm`). Linting and formatting rules are centralized at root level. Packages have to be run individually (e.g. `cd packages/docs && pnpm start` to start the development server).\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\nWe build robust and extendable APIs, to avoid future breaking changes as much as possible.\\nWe also ensure stable and reliable updates that align with semantic versioning. Breaking changes are documented prominently.\\n\\n## Quality assurance\\n\\nAll features and components must be automatically tested to catch regressions. We write tests to validate new features. We always provide storybook stories when authoring new components.\\nChromatic is used for checking visual differences. Open https://www.chromatic.com/build?appId=64f819d70a69cb8728e06daf to see and verify the latest changes. \\n\\n## Managing icons\\n\\nThe single source of truth for the Synergy icons is Figma. All icons are fetched from Figma into the assets project when calling the according script. Read the assets [README](https://github.com/synergy-design-system/synergy-design-system/blob/main/packages/assets/README.md) for further information.\\n\\n## Update dependencies\\n\\nWe regularly check for updates of our dependencies. This ensures that Synergy should have less security issues and that it stays easily maintainable. We also use GitHubs dependabot which creates automatic PRs as soon dependencies have been updated.\\n\\nThe most important dependency [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) is not managed via `pnpm` but via [vendorism](https://github.com/mariohamann/vendorism).\\nWe keep track of Shoelace and regularly integrate the latest versions from Shoelace using the `vendorism` scripts in `packages/components`. Read the components' [README](https://github.com/synergy-design-system/synergy-design-system/blob/main/packages/components/README.md#local-setup) for further information.\\n\\n\\n## Coding conventions\\n\\nWe are enforcing common code conventions via `eslint` and `stylelint`. Please make sure your code meets those conventions by linting your files or your PR may not be approved. You may use your editors eslint integration or run `pnpm lint` in the package that you are working on. Linting of all packages is also possible by issuing `pnpm lint` in the root of this repository.\\n\\nWhen writing components, use our defined list of design tokens for spacing, fonts or colors. As a rule of thumb, there should be no need to have a static color anywhere in your css code.\\n\\nComponents must be optimized for accessibility. Please use tools like AXE or Dev-Tools and have a look at the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for further information.\\n\\n### Ensure Accessibility\\n\\nWe use semantic HTML elements, ARIA landmarks, roles, states, and properties in components and storybook stories.\\nWe implement tests to ensure that interactive elements can be navigated and activated using the keyboard (tab-index) and ensure the correct sequence of navigation.\\nWe use descriptive text, labels, and instructions to provide context for non-text content.\\nWe ensure that dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers with ARIA live regions.\\n\\n### API\\n\\nAs stated in our goals, we focus on flexibility and adaptation. These goals are reached by providing proper APIs to our components. This means to prefer slots over attributes and to make use of CSS parts when meaningful.\\n\\n## Contribution workflow\\n\\nIf you want to contribute to this project, please [make sure that a similar issue does not exist yet](https://github.com/synergy-design-system/synergy-design-system/issues). If it does not exist, create a new issue, using one of our issue templates as a starting point. Create a new pull request, using `main` as source. Request a review when you are done with your changes.\\n\\n## Semantic release process\\n\\nIn our development workflow, we use Semantic Release to automate the release process for each package. This approach ensures that releases are consistent, predictable, and based on the analysis of relevant commit messages.\\n\\n### Pull requests and commits\\n\\nWhen creating pull requests use structured PR titles. The title is generated from the GitHub issue title: the issue templates guarantee that the following structure \\\"`prefix`:`icon` `text`\\\" is used.\\nWhen merging do a squash and merge. The PR title is used as the single commit message, which keeps the Git history clean. \\nThe `prefix` is processed when the PR is merged and decides about the release version. Depending on the title, merged PRs can also create a new Synergy version.\\n\\nTitle conventions for our PRs:\\n\\n`PREFIX: ICON DESCRIPTION`\\n\\nICON and PREFIX are one of the following:\\n\\n| Icon | Used for      | Commit Prefix | Description                 | Release Type |\\n| :--: | :------------ | :------------ | :-------------------------- | :----------- |\\n|  âœ¨  | Feature       | feat          | Add feature                 | Minor        |\\n|  ðŸ¤”  | Bugs          | fix           | Fix a bug                   | Patch        |\\n|  ðŸ“š  | Documentation | docs          | Add or update documentation | â€“            |\\n|  ðŸ”§  | Chore         | chore         | Do something else           | â€“            |\\n\\nExamples for valid PR titles:\\n\\n```\\nfix: ðŸ¤” Fix accessibility in syn-button\\nfeat: âœ¨ Add syn-radio\\ndocs: ðŸ“š Add installation instructions\\nchore: ðŸ”§ Improve build scripts\\n```\\n\\nIf a change is breaking, be aware that the string \\\"BREAKING CHANGE\\\" must be part of the footer (!) of the final commit message when doing the squash and merge. A change is breaking if a dependant project need to adapt (e.g. API has changed).\\n\\nBefore merging make sure that all sections are filled out properly and that all DoD checkmarks are checked.\\n\\nWhen committing changes use meaningful commit messages. Always imagine the perspective of an outsider: ask yourself, would he/she understand?\\n\\n\\n#### Assignees and reviewers\\n\\nWhen opening a PR, assign yourself and everyone who should be involved to the PR, at least one maintaining developer and if there are design related tasks a maintaining designer too. Design feedback is usually given via Chromatic.\\n\\n\\n## Release changes in framework wrapper packages\\n\\nFramework wrappers (e.g., for Angular) are automatically released when there are changes in the components package, managed by Semantic Release. While most files in the framework packages are auto-generated during the `components` package build, there are cases where manual modifications are necessary (e.g., updating `angular/README.md` or `react/package.json`).\\n\\nThe `createChecksums` script is vital in these scenarios. It performs a dry run of an npm publish and updates `components/package.json` with the checksums of the framework packages' tarballs. This process ensures that even manual changes in the framework packages are reflected in the components package without requiring manual intervention.\\n\\n### Example Workflow\\n\\n1. Modify `{framework-name}/package.json` or other files that get published on npm but are not automatically managed by `components`.\\n2. Run `cd packages/components && pnpm create-checksums` or `(cd packages/components &&) pnpm build`.\\n3. The script updates `components/package.json` with the new npm tarball's checksums.\\n4. Commit these changes along with your original modifications, following our structured commit message format.\\n5. Semantic Release will then automatically handle the release process based on these changes.\\n\\n### Automatic Checksum Verification and Update\\n\\nThe CI pipelines create and verify the wrapper project checksums. This check is automatically triggered after each commit. If discrepancies are found, the check fails and also the pipeline. This process helps to maintain the integrity and consistency of our release workflow, ensuring that manual changes are correctly accounted for in each release.\\n\\n\\n## Issue tracking\\n\\nWhen creating a new issue on GitHub we first decide which project to assign.\\n\\n|| synergy-design-system | design | internal |\\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\\n| use for | code changes in the mono repo | changes in the Figma designs | maintenance stuff like CI pipelines or orga topics |\\n| visibility | public | private | private |\\n\\n\\nContinue with selecting a proper template from the list. The template helps to use a structured title and content. After the issue is created it needs to be refined in the team, so everybody has a common understanding and that it is clear what the exact outcome is desired. Before working on the implementation this refinement process needs to be performed by at least 2 team members, usually the whole team.\\n\\n\\n> Note: We don't mention the names of internal or external colleagues in issues or other documents hosted on GitHub, as our project is public and can be accessed by anybody. The same goes for internal projects or products. Tagging/mentioning colleagues using their GitHub profiles is fine, as they decided to be visible on GitHub.\\n\\n\\n\"","import { Meta, Markdown } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport Contributing from '../../../CONTRIBUTING.md?raw';\n\n<Meta title=\"Contributing\" />\n\n<Markdown>{Contributing}</Markdown>\n"],"names":["Contributing","_createMdxContent","props","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","Markdown","MDXContent","MDXLayout","_provideComponents"],"mappings":"8TAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,ECKf,SAASC,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,OAAOC,EAAAA,KAAMC,EAAAA,SAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACC,EAAI,IAACC,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,cACb,CAAK,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMD,EAAI,IAACE,EAAU,CACvB,SAAUP,CAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASQ,EAAWN,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASO,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAER,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOO,EAAYJ,EAAAA,IAAKI,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEP,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUG,EAAAA,IAAKJ,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAuB,CAC/B"}
